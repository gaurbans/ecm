# ecm

This package allows users to build error correction models (ECM). While other R packages allow users to do this, the advantage to this package is that the user may select different variables for the transient and equilibrium terms of the ECM, and may also build an ECM in conjunction with backwards selection for variables.  

This is version 3.0.0
